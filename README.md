# Correlating the Performance of Computer Vision Algorithms with Objective Image Quality Metrics

See  https://www.imatest.com/2022/06/correlating-the-performance-of-computer-vision-algorithms-with-objective-image-quality-metrics for a full writeup

Configuring

pip install opencv-python pytesseract wand numpy

tesseract binaries can be found at https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/

ImageMagick can be installed at https://imagemagick.org/

This project uses [Imatest IT](https://www.imatest.com/products/imatest-it/) to produce objective image quality metrics.  You can obtain a [free trial of Imatest IT here](https://www.imatest.com/free-trial/)

You can generate images of Imatest charts for use in simulators using the [Imatest Target Generator Library](https://www.imatest.com/product/imatest-target-generator/).
